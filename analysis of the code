Sure, I'll outline the document structure for you based on the code provided:

Calculator Program Analysis

1. Introduction

   - Brief overview of the calculator program.
   - Purpose: Perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

2. Code Structure

   Main Function
     - Overview: Entry point of the program.
     - Responsibilities: Menu display, user input handling, operation execution.
     - Flow: Uses `switch` statement to select and perform operations based on user input.

   Switch Statement Cases
     - Case 1: Addition
       - Description: Handles addition operation.
       - Steps: Prompts user for two numbers, performs addition, and displays result.

     - Case 2: Subtraction
       - Description: Handles subtraction operation.
       - Steps: Prompts user for two numbers, performs subtraction, and displays result.

     - Case 3: Multiplication
       - Description: Handles multiplication operation.
       - Steps: Prompts user for two numbers, performs multiplication, and displays result.

     - Case 4: Division
       - Description: Handles division operation.
       - Steps: Prompts user for two numbers, performs division, and displays result.
       
     - Default Case
       - Description: Executes when user input is invalid.
       - Steps: Informs user to enter a correct menu option (1-4).

3. Functionality

   User Input Handling
     - Uses `scanf` to get user choice and operands.
     - `%d` for menu choice and `%f` for floating-point numbers.

   Arithmetic Operations
     - Addition: `result = num1 + num2;`
     - Subtraction: `result = num1 - num2;`
     - Multiplication: `result = num1 * num2;`
     - Division: `result = num1 / num2;`

4. Conclusion

   - Summary of the program's structure and functionality.
   - Mention of error handling (default case) and data types used (int, float).


This structure should help you create a Word document outlining the analysis of the calculator program, focusing on its structure, functionality, and how each part contributes to the overall functionality of the program.
